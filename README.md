# ❤️ Heart Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the risk of heart disease using machine learning models based on user medical data. It aims to provide early warning signs by analyzing various health indicators, making it a useful tool for patients and healthcare professionals.

## 📌 Features

- Accepts medical input features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and more
- Uses machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Predicts likelihood of heart disease
- Clean and simple user interface (if frontend added)
- Can be deployed as a web app for real-world usage

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and analysis)

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the (heart risk.csv)  
It includes features such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia


## 🧪 How It Works

1. Dataset is preprocessed and cleaned.
2. Feature scaling is applied where necessary.
3. Data is split into training and testing sets.
4. Different machine learning models are trained and evaluated.
5. The best-performing model is selected for final prediction.
6. Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix are used to evaluate performance.
